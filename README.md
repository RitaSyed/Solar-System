# Solar System

## Description
1. The page displays planets of our solar system as cards.
1. When the user moves their mouse over a planet card, the name disappears and the image of the planet takes up the whole card.
1. When the user clicks on a planet card, all the cards disappear and the only thing displayed on the page is information about the planet they clicked on.
1. When the user clicks on the red X on a single planet that information goes away and all the original cards are displayed again.
1. When the user types in the search bar, planet cards show up if they have what is typed in their name or description.
